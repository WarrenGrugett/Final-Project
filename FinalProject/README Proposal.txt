Description:
The objective is to defend yourself from enemy troops. Each level has a unique map and troops sent against you.

By winning, you progress to the next level and play in a new map of increasing difficulty. Good luck! 


Instructions:
To deploy a tower/troop, select it by clicking on it in the panel. Then, click on any of the available spaces on the map. You must have sufficient funds to do so.
