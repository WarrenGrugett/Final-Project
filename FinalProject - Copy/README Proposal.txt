By winning, you progress to the next level and play in a new map of increasing difficulty. Good luck!

Feedback:
Questions:
What does ____ mean in the description? Resolved
What is the program name? Resolved
What does the user use to click the troops and towers?: Mouse 
What are the available spaces to put troops down? The concrete outside the grass
Do you start off with all the troops or do you unlock them at some point? You have all troops/towers at the beginning of the game but you can upgrade them at some point in the game.

Criticism:
The game is very similar to other tower defense games in particular clash royale
Adding more troops would diversify the game as well as user’s playstyle

You could add unique power ups 
Find a general theme for the game
Add troop and tower superclasses
